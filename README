# Flask-Markdown-BRM

A fork of [Flask-Markdown](https://github.com/dcolish/flask-markdown) whose goal, ultimately, is to be merged back into the orginal.

## Why a Fork?

There are 4 reasons/goals for this fork.

1. The origal Flask-Markdown was not responding to Issues or Pull Requests.
2. Ensure the repository conforms to pep8 & pep257 standards (prefering pep257 where they conflict), and to convert nose tests into pytest.
3. Conform to current Flask plugins standards.
4. Add in a few minor features.
